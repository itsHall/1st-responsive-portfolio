# 1st-responsive-portfolio

### Late 2017 - Advanced Web Design WVU
##### Bootstrap

The first project in Fall was to redesign the previous 960 grid portfolio website and make it responsive using Bootstrap and general relative values. Eventually I got tired of this design and decided to redesign it in early 2018 and still use it (August 2018).

Is it weird to go back and change college work?... asking for a friend.
